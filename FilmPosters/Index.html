    <p id="Board"> Film has always been a huge source of inspiration for me,<br> so I decided to create two posters to pay tribute to some of <br>my favourite films.</p>

    <h3>Screen One</h3>
    <p id="WallflowerWords"> Inspired by the grid-layout of Josef Muller-Brockman, this<br> is my design for a poster for one of my all time favourite films<br> (and books), Stephen Chbosky's "The Perks of Being a Wallflower".<br> <br>
        
I created a geometric shape to be the main focus of the<br> poster, which resembles a flower and is made up from many<br> overlapped infinity signs, a reference to one of the most <br>important lines of the book- "And in that moment, I<br> swear we were infinite.". <br> <br>
        
I feel that the sense of movement given by this infinity<br> sign reflects the anxious feeling that Charlie seems to have<br> in the film- he is being swept up in the events of the lives<br> of those around him.  </p>
    
    <img id="Wall2" src="Images/Wall2.png">
    
    <h3 id="ScreenTwo"> Screen Two</h3>
    
    <p id="JunoWords">
    I wanted the design of this poster to reflect the strikingly<br> realistic and bizarre comedy that is a feature of the film.<br> Even the visual imagery is a reference to the line from the film -<br><br>
"How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests? That's amazing...".
