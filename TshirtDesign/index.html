    <h1 id="LineStudy">"Cthulhuccino"-<br> Straight Line Study and T-shirt Design</h1>
    
    <p id="CthulhuText"> A finished line study for IxDBelfast, inspired by the tales of H. P. Lovecraft (more specifically "The Call of Cthulhu") and drinking a good cup of coffee when reading. The design for this piece had to be finished in a week and the brief stated that I was only to use lines to create a piece of design. <br><br>

I wanted to challenge myself to create imagery of something that is curved and flowing; something not readily associated with straight lines and harsh angles. In this case, I used the tentacles in this piece to mimic steam rising from the mug slowly and at first glance I wanted people to believe that it is just steam. I found the constraints of only using line challenging but thoroughly interesting; we use lines in design probably every day but do not nessisarailly limit ourselves to just using straight lines in a piece. <br><br>

I feel that the realisation that the steam is in fact tentacles stretching out from the mug adds a slightly dark and sinister feel to the piece, and conveys what H. P. Lovecraft strived to create in his work- the sudden discovery of a hidden terror.<br><br></p>
    
<p id="Threadless"> A submission of this design on a vest top got accepted to the community voting stages on the t-shirt design website, Threadless. Although it did not get accepted into the next stage, the 180 votes and numerous inquiries I revieved about this design inspired me to take this design further and as of December 2016 I am working towards screen-printing my own t-shirts and paper prints.</p>

    <p id="Process"> For me, starting on paper is essential. I like to flesh out my ideas on paper before taking them to the screen as I find it less restrictive and it helps me to generate ideas as I feel that a blank screen can be sometimes more intimidating than a blank page. <br><br>These sketches were a small selection of Cthulhuccino ideas, and you can even see other literary ideas creeping into this, such as the "Great Rooibos Dragon" in the bottom right corner of the page- a pun referring to "The Great Red Dragon" mentioned in Thomas Harris' Hannibal series.<br><br>Being able to incorporate other media that inspires you into a project can be really exciting, and I think this is one of the reasons I enjoyed this project so much and decided to take it further than just creating a piece of visual design and not trying to take it further. I have learned a lot about creating and marketing a design from this one piece alone, so I am excited to see where futute projects will take me and what I can learn from them. </p>
